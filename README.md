## Posting Webpage

Welcome to the Posting-Webpage , a multi-page web application that allows users to post and delete content on different pages. The app has three pages: Page 1, Page 2, and Page 3. Each page has a form that allows users to post content, which will be displayed on that page.

Additionally, the app has a special form page that in future will be only visible and functional for the owner or user logged in . On this page, the owner can select which page they want to post content to, and their content will be displayed on the selected page. The owner can also delete any content that they have posted on any of the pages.

# Future plans

In the future, I plan to expand the functionality of the app to include the ability to embed code, such as players, using the form page. Stay tuned for updates!

# Usage

To use the app, simply navigate to the desired page and use the form to post content. To delete content, click on the delete button next to the content you wish to remove. If you are the owner of the app and want to use the special form page, click on the link to access it.

this project works with a mongodb to save the data.
